# Face-Recogntion-Based-Security-System

This project is based on Pyhton's OpenCV library which does the work of computer vision. In this project a Opencv is set up to detect Human faces and recognising them as an individual person by showing their names also. The machine learning model is trained by providing some pictures of that person and our machine recognise the face in real time using Webcam or any related camera device and shows the name by drawing a recatngle on the face.
